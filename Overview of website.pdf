Website Overview
When originally looking into the design of my website, I wanted it to be a sleek, flowing, informative website that looked professional and gave the user a small insight of me as a student/worker. Because of this I decided that the best way for me to demonstrate my skills in website design and provide a website that covered all of these areas is making a portfolio of myself.
Due to me having a basic understanding of JavaScript, CSS and HTML, I was able to format my website correctly, make sure I have DIVs layer out in correct ways, and decide on areas that certain bits of content will be placed. I originally came up with 4 pages. Home, Contact, CV and projects.
I decided very early on that the Home page will be a very basic, professional introduction page hosting each of the subtitles at the top for easy navigation, a title being my name in the middle followed by what the website is, then lastly providing a picture of myself to fill some blank areas. This was to make sure that it wasn't too empty, but also was not a cluttered and ugly first page for the user to see.
The second page, being Contact, is pretty self explanatory. It will provide the user with multiple different ways of contacting myself. I kept the same continuous theme to my website, with a title in the middle followed by what the website is, and the sub titles at the top, but for this page I added 3 logos of different social media platforms that the viewer of the website can contact me through if they have any questions regarding my portfolio. I also wanted to include a social media platform more related to work such as LinkedIn. This means that people viewing my portfolio for work purposes know that I am active in the work side of social media, and want to stay engaged and active throughout my time of searching for work.  Again, I tried to keep this page as simple as possible, as having to navigate through a cluttered, overcrowded website is never fun.
The third page is a simple yet functional page. It includes the continuous design I have used on other pages, and a button saying "Link to CV", which takes the user to a picture of my CV that can be downloaded and viewed by a company if I am applying for a job there.
Finally, the Projects page. This page is definitely the more complex page as it uses JavaScript functions to get popup menus as you hover over the subheading. I made sure to close the menu whenever the mouse leaves the two project pictures as having a menu pop up and not close will just clutter the screen and get in the way. This menu is also interactable, meaning if you click on either of the pictures seen, it will take you to individual pages hosting 3D rotating viewable models of the projects I have included. This allows the user to get an understanding of what I am working on at the moment, and some of my most proud work. I also included titles that tell the viewer what the model is, for example a Damaged Helmet being my first model. I thought about including a brief explanation on this page, however I found that the model provides enough understanding to people that are viewing the page as you are able to rotate and closely examine it.
During the creation of the website, as stated earlier I already have a basic understanding of web design meaning I did not necessarily need to look up exact assets I can include in the website, all I needed to research was syntax errors when trying to remember how to perform certain functions. However, when it came to implementing my viewmodels to allow the viewer to inspect my models, I had to follow a tutorial on inputting those models to my website. My design was completely original and I wanted to ensure that it was my design only, so I chose to use no other websites as an influence or inspiration, and designed this website entirely off of my own imagination. 
As time progresses and I work on more projects and gather more information I can include on this portfolio throughout my course at University, I had made it so there is more than enough room to fill with other information, and also have some other menus set up that are hidden on other subtitles, at the moment being the CV menu.
Overall, I think I have produced a professional looking, informative and interactive website that provides good functionality and the information someone looking at a portfolio would need.
